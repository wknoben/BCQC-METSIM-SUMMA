# Installing metSIM 

There is a single script in the METSIM_INSTALLATION folder, INSTALL_METSIM.sh. This .sh script will not run. To install metSIM, paste the file's commands one by one into a terminal window. The comments that are marked with #DOWNLOAD: have files that will have to be downloaded. Follow the download instructions that are provided by the commands and linked websites. This procedure must be used every time plato or graham (high performance computing clusters) are reopened to make sure all of the necessary modules are loaded and MetSim is properly installed.
